# 11ty-with-ts-modules
A test bed for me figuring out how to add client-side Typescript compilation as well as rollup bundling to support coding in modules but still being able to support 
older browsers that don't support [javascript modules via script tag](https://caniuse.com/?search=javascript%20modules%20via%20script%20tag) in the 
[Eleventy static site generator](https://www.11ty.dev/). The code here works for my particular use case; your mileage may vary.
